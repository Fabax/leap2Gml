leap2Gml
========

leapToGml is a processing project that aim to combine the leap motion with the gml file format created by evan roth. 

#How does it work ? 

- plug your leap motion to your computer 
- run the sketch
- start your drawing 
- name your file
- save it 
- your file is now under a gml folder on the root of the processing project.

I you want to replay your drawing : 
- click on load gml (load the gml file name you type in the text field on top of the application)
- play gml ( it's still a beta version so might want to click once or twice :p )
